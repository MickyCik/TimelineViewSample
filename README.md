## Creating Custom Controls Part 3: TimelineView

Hey Guys!

In the [second part of this series](https://www.pujolsluis.com/creating-custom-controls-part-2-sliderview/) of articles about creating custom controls, we learned how to create an SlideView made with a Custom Stepper + CarouselView (SliderView) to support sliders in our Xamarin Forms Apps.

In this article we are going to see our next use case which is creating a Timeline to display a list of events or logs that happend through time in our Xamarin Forms Apps.

### The Use cases we will be talking about through this series will be the following:

- Endless Scrolling + ItemTapped (ExtendedListView)
- Custom Stepper + Carousel view (SliderView)
- Timeline of Events (TimeLineView)
 
Our use case to dive into on creating custom controls Part 3 will be the **TimelineView**
